## What it going on in this project?

Everything started when i needed to prepare some coding exercises for
candidates who applied for Junior Backend Java Developer positions in my company.
So my idea was to create public repo with some simply coding exercises.

First program which candidates get is in **exercises/factory/first**<BR>
Resolved exercises are in folder resolved.

If I will have some ideas I will add next code snippet.
