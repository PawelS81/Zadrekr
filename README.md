## What it going on in this project?

Every thing started when i needed prepare some code exercises for 
candidates which applyed on Junior Backend Java Developer position to my company.
So my idea was create public repo for some simply code exercises.

First program which candidates gets is in **exercises/factory/first**.<br>
Resolved exercises are in folder resolved.

If I will have some ideas will add next code snippet.
